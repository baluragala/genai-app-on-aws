RAG Application Development: The generative AI application should be built using LangChain framework with a streamlit frontend with OpenAI model as the LLM.

Docker: Once the application was built, you must dockerised the application by creating a dockerfille and a docker-compose file.

Note:

- use best practices
- use logging
- use in memory chroma
- use python env based impl
